Welcome to Protein Prediction 2! This course is an introduction to functional prediction and techniques for interactively visualizing data. 

**Topics will include:**

 * Predicting protein function using sequence: sequence alignments, multiple sequence alignments, motifs, domain assignment, annotation transfer by homology, ab    initio predictions
 * Predicting protein function using structure: structural alignments, structural motifs, annotation transfer via structure similarity
 * From structure prediction to function prediction: comparative modeling; prediction of: secondary structure, hydrophilicity profiles, solvent accessibility, transmembrane segments, disordered regions, contact maps, functional residues; template free modeling
 * Machine learning

**After successful completion of the exercise, you will be able to...**

 * Critically evaluate visualizations and suggest improvements and refinements
 * Use JavaScript and other tools to scrape, clean, and process data
 * Use standalone visualization applications to quickly explore data
 * Create web-based interactive visualizations using JavaScript, D3 and BioJS
 * Contribute to biological visualization (and get famous!)

## Course Logistics

Will be announced

### Prerequisites

 * Students are expected to have solid programming experience in at least one programming language
 * Curiosity about learning the secret of life and awesome JavaScript!

### Required Textbooks

We will be use one textbook for this class to teach the necessary technical skills. 

[Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](http://www.amazon.com/Interactive-Data-Visualization-Scott-Murray-ebook/dp/B00BSG68UQ), Scott Murray, O'Reilly (2013)

*An introduction to D3 for people new to programming and web development, published by O’Reilly. “Explaining tricky technical topics with aplomb (and a little cheeky humor) is Scott Murray’s forte. If you want to dive into the world of dynamic visualization using web standards, even if you are new to programming, this book is the place to start.” - Mike Bostock, creator of D3*

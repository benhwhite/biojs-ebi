## Motivation
With the advent of high-throughput technologies biology is experiencing a data revolution. What started as the challenge to sequence the human genome has grown into the need to compare thousands of genomes, and to understand DNA sequences in the context of many other types of measured biological data. Biologists use visualizations in their everyday workflow to help them explore and understand this massive amount of data. In this lecture we work closely with biologists to design visualization tools that support efficient scientific inquiry and provide new biological insights.

## Audience 
This tutorial is for bioinformaticians and developers interested in presenting biological information on the web. Basic programming knowledge is required to attend this tutorial. The workshop can be followed without knowledge of JavaScript, but scripting experience with JavaScript is highly recommended for participants.

## Learning objectives
After this course you should be able to:

* Review approaches to data processing for the web
* Utilise BioJS components and the BioJS registry
* Create a simple BioJS component yourself
* Apply basic BioJS concepts for data visualisation for the web
* Begin to develop new BioJS components for your own work

For your final assignment in this course you will work on a project. The goal of the project is to design and implement a web-based interactive visualization that allows you to answer questions you have about biological data. You will design your visualization, implement it using modern web frameworks, and evaluate the results. 

## Project Team
You will work closely with other classmates in a **2-3 person project team**. You can come up with your own teams and use Piazza to find prospective team members. If you canâ€™t find a partner we will team you up randomly. We recognize that individual schedules, different time zones, preferences, and other constraints might limit your ability to work in a team. If this the case, ask us for permission to work alone. In general, we do not anticipate that the grades for each group member will be different. However, we reserve the right to assign different grades to each group member based on peer assessments (see below).

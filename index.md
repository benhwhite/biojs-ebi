With the advent of high-throughput technologies biology is experiencing a data revolution. What started as the challenge to sequence the human genome has grown into the need to compare thousands of genomes, and to understand DNA sequences in the context of many other types of measured biological data. Biologists use visualizations in their everyday workflow to help them explore and understand this massive amount of data. In this research we work closely with biologists to design visualization tools that support efficient scientific inquiry and provide new biological insights.

We work closely with biologists working in the field of genomics and systems biology to design visualization tools that enable complex, exploratory data analysis.
In this course you will learn to predict the functions of proteins, state of the art prediction techniques in bioinformatics, tools for visualization of biological data, and programming of interactive web-based visualizations for biology using [D3](http://d3js.org/) and [BioJS](http://biojs.net/).
